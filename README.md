# Flash-Cards


## Abstract 

Flash-Cards is a Turing School of Software and Design Mod 2 project which included finishing a flash cards program that will prompt a user with questions in the terminal and allow them to answer. Using a basic structure of class files, tests suites were written and then classes were built out to create the desired functionality.
